# Riviera Beauty Interiors - Yacht Provisioning Management System

This is an internal management system for **Riviera Beauty Interiors**, a specialized provisioning company serving the luxury yacht industry.

## Business Context

Riviera Beauty Interiors manages orders for yacht owners, handling everything from luxury linens and cosmetics to personalized amenities. The company acts as a single point of contact, consolidating orders from multiple suppliers into unified deliveries for yacht owners.

## Project Vision

This application is being developed as part of a Master's program to modernize and streamline the entire business workflow. The system will evolve in phases:

### Phase 1: Inventory Management (In Development)

A comprehensive internal inventory management system that helps track stock, organize items, monitor supplier details, and prevent shortages.

### Phase 2: Task Management (Planned)

A customized, user-friendly task management system (mini-Jira) tailored specifically for the team's workflow. Unlike generic project management tools, this will be:

- Designed with non-technical users in mind
- Integrated directly with inventory data
- Focused on order fulfillment workflows
- Connected to active orders and delivery schedules

### Phase 3: Client Portal (Future)

A dedicated portal for yacht owners to:

- Track delivery status in real-time
- View order history
- Place quick reorders of previously purchased items
- Streamline communication between clients and the provisioning team
